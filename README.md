## Hi, I'm Hanif Jilani! ðŸ‘‹

<img align="right" src = "1200px-Michigan_Wolverines_logo.svg.png" width = "90" height = "60"/>
<br>
<p>I am student at the <b>University of Michigan Ann Arbor</b> studying Computer Science Engineering. I have always been curious about the various softwares we use in our day-to-day life, how they were made, how to make something that useful to humanity as well.

I learned to code on my own during the end of middle school using Udemy courses and youtube videos. I started with web development (HTML, CSS & JS) since I had a design background. I then moved to Nodejs, which is the framework I spent the most time on. The ability to use APIs to create hundreds of wonderful, useful and powerful applications felt like a dream. Another section of CS I ventured into was NLP. I discovered that I could actually create chatbots using a software called DialogFlow. I then used Nodejs and Dialogflow to make some powerful and dynamic chatbots. After going to Umich, I also started learning and mastering C++ for coursework.

I always have a huge interest and passion when it comes to Computer Science and this persistence helps me solve the problems and achieve the goals I want to.</p>
