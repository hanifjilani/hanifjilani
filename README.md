  <li><b>Priority Queue Implementation</b> - Implemented three priority queue types (Sorted Array, Binary Heap, Pairing Heap) with specific runtime guarantees in C++</li>
  <li><b>Mine Escape</b> - Designed a pathfinding algorithm using custom priority queues to dynamically clear obstacles based on blast cost and tie-break rules</li>
  <li><b>Letterman</b> - Built a BFS/DFS word transformation solver using custom containers and STL optimizations.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>üßÆ Data Structures & Algorithms (EECS280 - UofM)</h3>
 <ul>
  <li><b>Piazza Classifier</b> - Used NLP and ML to classify forum posts from a social platform</li>
